# RPGGenerator
Java application that generates a character for a standard Role-Playing game. Uses a PostgreSQL database to store character information.

Characters can be generated manually, or through randomizing stats. Once created, they are dropped into a simple RPG story with combat and decision making.


After each level, progress is saved to the database so that the next time the user logs in, they can resume where they left off.
